# Signed multi-package APT repository

The package catalog is published at `https://packages.elixpo.com/`, with Win Dot Panel at `/win-dot-panel/`, ScreenBridge at `/screenbridge/`, and stable packages at `/apt/`. Both applications and their releases live in `elixpo/packages.elixpo`. The deployment workflow selects the latest stable namespaced release for each product, verifies both packages, builds one signed APT index, and deploys the site atomically through GitHub Pages.

## Quick install

```bash
curl -fsSL -o /var/tmp/win-dot-panel-install.sh \
  https://packages.elixpo.com/win-dot-panel/install.sh && \
bash /var/tmp/win-dot-panel-install.sh
```

This checks the repository key fingerprint, registers the signed APT source, and installs the latest stable package. The current signing key fingerprint is `1D7C BFA8 E3D9 599C 7CA0 3B86 EEEA 89F4 C2DB 5DE5`.

## Manual setup

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl gnupg
sudo install -d -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL -o /var/tmp/elixpo-packages.asc \
  https://packages.elixpo.com/apt/keyring.asc
sudo gpg --dearmor --yes -o /etc/apt/keyrings/elixpo-packages.gpg \
  /var/tmp/elixpo-packages.asc
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/elixpo-packages.gpg] https://packages.elixpo.com/apt/ ./' | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elixpo-packages.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install win-dot-panel
```

The same source can install `screenbridge`; do not register the repository a second time. Existing installations using `win-dot-panel.list` remain valid, and a new product installer migrates that source to the generic filename.

## Publishing architecture

- `elixpo/packages.elixpo` owns both application sources, GitHub Releases, GitHub Pages, the custom domain, and `APT_SIGNING_KEY`.
- Stable package binaries use product-prefixed tags: `win-dot-panel/v...` and `screenbridge/v...`.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-packages.yml` verifies both releases, builds the shared index, signs it, and deploys one Pages artifact.
- Each stable product release invokes that shared deployment workflow directly.

## One-time maintainer setup

1. Keep GitHub Pages on **GitHub Actions** with the custom domain `packages.elixpo.com`.
2. Keep the existing `packages` CNAME pointed at the Pages host for the `elixpo` organization and retain the domain-verification TXT record.
3. In **Environments → github-pages**, allow `win-dot-panel/v*`, `screenbridge/v*`, and the `main` branch.
4. Keep `APT_SIGNING_KEY` in this repository's Actions secrets and maintain an offline backup of its private key.
5. Run **Deploy packages.elixpo.com** manually when either package release must be republished without a new tag.

## Release process

1. Publish application releases with tags matching `<product>/v<upstream-version>-<Debian-revision>`.
2. Let the application workflow upload its versioned `.deb` and `SHA256SUMS`.
3. The package-site workflow downloads the latest release for both products, verifies checksums and package identities, then signs and deploys the combined repository.
4. Confirm `/win-dot-panel/`, `/screenbridge/`, both installers, `/apt/InRelease`, `/apt/Packages.gz`, and both files under `/apt/pool/`.

The GitHub updater remains available for Win Dot Panel development builds.
